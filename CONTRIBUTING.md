This is an open source project, and we appreciate your help!

We use the GitHub issue tracker to discuss new features and non-trivial bugs.

In addition to the issue tracker, #journeys on Slack is the best way to get into contact with the project's maintainers.

To contribute code, documentation, or tests, please submit a pull request to the GitHub repository. Generally, we expect two maintainers to review your pull request before it is approved for merging. For more details, see the MAINTAINERS page.
